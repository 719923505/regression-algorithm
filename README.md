====================
Including some experimental code for the LOWESS, Liner, and Polynomial Regression algorithm. 


Demo

####1. LOWESS
![LOWESS] (./imgs/lowess.png?raw=true "LOWESS")

####2. Liner Regression
![Liner Regression] (./imgs/liner.png?raw=true "Liner Regression")

####3. Polynomial Regression

Dependency
----------
It's based on SciPy

####1. Ubuntu
```shell
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
```
####2. Redhat/CentOS
```shell
sudo yum install numpy scipy python-matplotlib ipython python-pandas sympy python-nose
```

####3. Windows/Mac
The easiest way to install the packages of the SciPy stack is to download one of these Python distributions, which includes all the key packages:

*[Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html): A free distribution for the SciPy stack. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.
*[Enthought Canopy](http://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/): The free and commercial versions include the core SciPy stack packages. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.
*[Python(x,y)](http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/): A free distribution including the SciPy stack, based around the Spyder IDE. Windows only.
*[WinPython](http://code.google.com/p/winpython/): A free distribution including the SciPy stack. Windows only.
*[Pyzo](http://www.pyzo.org/): A free distribution based on Python 3 (see Note on Python 3) with the IEP editor. Supports Linux and Windows.
*[Algorete Loopy](http://algorete.org/): A free, community oriented distribution for the SciPy stack maintained by researches at Dartmouth College. Loopy supports both Python 2 and 3 on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. The distribution is derived from Anaconda with additional packages (e.g. Space Physics, BioInformatics).
